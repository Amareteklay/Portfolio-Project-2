# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game

Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game where players form a rock, paper or scissors with their hands. They make the choice simultaneously so that none of the players get any information about the other player's strategy. The problem with the Rock Paper Scissors game is that each player has only a small number of (i.e., three) possible strategies and the players end up in a tie more often. 

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is an extension of the former. Now each player has five different possible strategies to choose from, and the likelihood that two players end up in a tie in a given round is lower. 
In other words, the winner can easily be determined and players can resolve their issue quickly. They save time.

In this application, a player is able to play with the computer. Computer here refers to devices with a range of screen sizes such as computers, tablet and smartphones.

## Goals
The owner and the user of an application have different goals in mind. The former needs to consider the goals of the latter to develop an application that is relevant and has the key features the user would like to see. 
### User goals
- The goal the user of the Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is to find an online game where they can play with the computer and experience a fair amount of challenge and unpredictability.

## Color Scheme
I have used colors that are associated with calmness and positive feelings. 
- The background color is [Teal](https://coolors.co/d81159-8f2d56-218380-fbb13c-73d2de) which, [according to canva.com](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-meanings/teal/), "combines the calming properties of blue with the renewal qualities of green. It is a revitalizing and rejuvenating color that also represents open communication and clarity of thought." 
- White font on a teal or blue background gives a comfortable contrast to read. 
- The choices that players make also change colors in response to the events (such as hover).
- After each round, the results screen shows the strategies of the player and the computer in different colors depending on whether one won or lost that particular round. This will enable the players play faster as they can quickly tell who won.
